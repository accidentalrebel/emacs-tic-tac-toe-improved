Tic-tac-toe game project for me to practice my Emacs Lisp.

This is an improved version of the same unfinished game [I made long ago](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-tic-tac-toe-game). This one has specific keymapped controls, sound effects, as well as unit tests!

Uses my personal [coordinate.el](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/coordinate.el) library.

Based on the talk by Zachary Kanfer titled "Writing Games with Emacs" given at the New York Emacs Meetup. Video can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk39mp8Vy4M).
