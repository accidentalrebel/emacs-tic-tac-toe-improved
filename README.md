# emacs-tic-tac-toe-improved
Tic-tac-toe game project for me to practice my Emacs Lisp.

This is an improved version of the same unfinished game [I made long ago](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-tic-tac-toe-game). This one has specific keymapped controls as well as unit tests!

Based on the talk by Zachary Kanfer titled "Writing Games with Emacs" given at the New York Emacs Meetup. Video can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk39mp8Vy4M).
